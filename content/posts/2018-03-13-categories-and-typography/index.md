One more day of development on this site, some more updates available. It's nice to see the thing evolving!

Today I could improve considerably the typography, again... Yeah, because wasn't good enough on previous version. Although I still think it always have room for more improvement, but need to focus on the schedule and deliver small changes at a time.

Checkout the list of updates:

- Got rid of that sidebar in favor of the tabs navigation in the header;
- The page have more space for text and have white background;
- New font families for headings and text;
- The post listing have icons for the categories;
- The category page was assembled to list that category's posts;
- Categories is now a content type, maybe will have a poster image in the future;
- Looks a bit better on mobile, although more work is still required to be fully mobile-friendly;

## Categories

The idea of categories is to provide a way to have a collection of posts. A category is not exactly the same of a tag by some reasons:

- Categories are unique per posts and a post can have many tags;
- Categories have own pages while tags will only have a dynamic filter on [search page](https://bernardodiasc.github.io/search/);

At the time of this post, the content are available into 3 categories:

- [Third-party integrations](https://bernardodiasc.github.io/category/third-party/)
- [This blog development process](https://bernardodiasc.github.io/category/this-blog/)
- [Strategy & Entrepreneurship](https://bernardodiasc.github.io/category/strategy/)

## Typography

Well, the previous choices for typography wasn't good, so I'm testing a new combination :)

- **Permanent Marker** for the site title
- **Cairo** for the headings
- **Karma** for the text

## Screenshots

Some screenshots to keep a history of the changes.
