# Development

[TBP]

To do:

## Framework

- Datasource
  - Should be fully mockable
  - Json schemas act like signatures
  - Mocked data can come from API
- Screens perform data translation
- Displays should be modeled to expect all different states
- Tools should help the developer and automate systems

### Datasource

- `/data.json` is created using `/config/filestojson.js`
- `/public/content` is where files are located
- [Docs](https://bernardodiasdacruz.com/docs/?selectedKind=Getting%20started&selectedStory=Content%20instructions)

### Screens

- [`/src/screens`](https://github.com/bernardodiasc/bernardodiasc.github.io/tree/develop/src/screens/) is where screen component files are located
- [Docs](https://bernardodiasdacruz.com/docs/?selectedKind=Screens&selectedStory=About%20screen%20components

### Displays

- [`/src/displays`](https://github.com/bernardodiasc/bernardodiasc.github.io/tree/develop/src/displays/) is where screen component files are located
- [Docs](https://bernardodiasdacruz.com/docs/?selectedKind=Displays&selectedStory=About%20display%20components

## Tools
