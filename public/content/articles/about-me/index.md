# About Bernardo Dias da Cruz

I'm the author and developer of this site. Here I share my random thoughts about web development and everything else that I consider meaningful on a professional scope.

Information technology can be an art and manage all this abstract material have a quite wide range of ways. I'm specialized on user experience, on the client-side of web development. Have been doing code for browsers since 2003 and my expertise is based on over a hundred projects made.

To outline a few of my experiences:

- Training in entrepreneurship, owner attitude
- Marketing research and brainstorming of ideas
- Bootstrapping projects and front-end architecture for scale
- Planning and coordinating development
- Leading development teams, supporting teammates
- Analysis of problems and solution research
- User experience and bulletproofing user interface
