GraphQL is really interesting, I'm enjoying so far. Before having the opportunity to work in a production grade project that relies on this technology, I started doing a lot researches on the subject.

## Hello World prototypes

These are some hands-on projects I made that relies on GraphQL.

- [Full-stack GraphQL with Apollo, Meteor & React](https://github.com/bernardodiasc/hello-world/tree/master/my-meteor-apollo-graphql-react-app)
