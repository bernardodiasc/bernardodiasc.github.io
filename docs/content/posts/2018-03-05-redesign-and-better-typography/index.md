Creating new post:

```

Yeah, that's how it looks my content generator. After that a Markdown file created with basic YML variables being used on posts.

Heading to the what this post is all about:

## Design and typography progress

Disclaimer: I'm not a designer, what I do good is to make code out of graphic designs. Art direction is a whole different skill that requires huge experience and dedication. But step by step this project will look prettier, let's see what we've got so far.

### First round

This version was most minimalistic as possible. I haven't planned any design for this site so was more a matter to display content black&white that doesn't looked like browser defaults and some minimal structure for layout the content and navigation.

</a>

### Second round

Few hours more, many CSS lines more. On this stage I've focused on creating some more CSS structures, more colours and an attempt of a design theme. The typography here still looks awful ðŸ˜…

### Third round

For the third round was very important to make the typography better. I started sharing my blog already and not everyone gets the fact that state of art takes a lot time, the time I haven't yet spent on this project. But being a text content site by essence, make the reading experience good is crucial.

I choose 2 font families to work with, both provided by [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/):

- **Lato** for common texts
- **Playfair Display** for headings

The blueprint theme relates to things I love to do, as in sketching UI, wireframing layout and information and front end architecture. Bootstraping projects is really fun for me. So I'm intended to explore a lot these subjects here in this blog, this theme kinda of made sense to me and I hope it sticks. ðŸ˜„

On more technical details, I've created a lot CSS Variables to store constant values for typography, as colours and font-faces. During design updates I did a lot tries and updating directly on CSS variables, and that made this process much easier.

I also created the `<TextBlock />` component [(see example on docs)](https://bernardodiasc.github.io/docs/?selectedKind=Displays%2FTextBlock&selectedStory=Example) to hold all the typography styles within. I'll dedicate one post just to explain why I isolate typography styles from global CSS scope, for now only a very basic typography styles are set on `body` and `h1-6`, and global resets on HTMl elements that are mostly set to inherit from parents.
